## Welcome to the Seabass Tool
***


This tool was developed as a [technical service](TechnicalService.pdf) to DGMARE in 2019 and uses the most recent available data on seabass (*Dicentrarchus labrax*) catches in divisions 4.b–c, 7.a, and 7.d–h (central and southern North Sea, Irish Sea, English Channel, Bristol Channel, and Celtic Sea).

<br>

**The Seabass tool is not an ICES advice and cannot be applied as such**; the ICES advice on Seabass can be found here: [ICES, 2021a](https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Advice/2021/2021/bss.27.4bc7ad-h.pdf)

<br>

The sea bass catch allocation tool was developed to allow managers and stakeholders to test multiple catch allocation scenarios by gear and different regulations for recreational catches, using the ICES catch advice (ICES, 2021b) as a maximum. It should be noted that the tool is assuming that each vessel will uptake its full catch allocation.

<br>

None of the scenarios nor implementations are specific ICES recommendations.

<br>

The sea bass catch allocation tool was developed to be used **exclusively** for sea bass (*Dicentrarchus labrax*) in divisions 4.b–c, 7.a, and 7.d–h (central and southern North Sea, Irish Sea, English Channel, Bristol Channel, and Celtic Sea) in 2021. The basic assumptions used in the tool to forecast the catches are closely linked to the assessment of this stock (ICES, 2021a) and any attempt to use it for other stocks will not produce sensible results. The Seabass tool is updated annually with updated data produced by the Working Group for the Celtic Seas Ecoregion  ([WGCSE](https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGCSE.aspx))


<br>

Although, this tool is designed to be in line with the basic assumptions used in the sea bass advice there are instances where it deviates from them (e.g. the tool can be used to allocate monthly options, while the assessment is run an annual time step).
